            "Don't try to get around limits, security or another user's access.",

        "items": [
            "A company's logo must be one it has the right to use.",
            "The verified check means that an owner or admin signed in with a work email on the company's website. It doesn't mean we vouch for the company.",
            "Anyone with an interview's shareable link can take the interview, and each person who does is charged like an invited candidate. The company decides where it shares the link.",
            "A company that sends a report is responsible for whom it sends it to.",
            "Results support a company's decision; they don't make it. A company reviews them before deciding, doesn't reject a candidate on the score alone, and lets a candidate ask for a person to review their result.",
            "A company gives a candidate who needs it an accommodation, such as extra time, which it can set for each candidate before they start.",
            "A company that connects its own tools (an applicant tracking system, Slack, or its systems through prepza's API and web hooks) chooses where its candidates' results go and is responsible for those tools, and doesn't set them up to reject candidates automatically on prepza's results.",
            "API keys and web hooks' secrets are the company's to keep secret: anything done with a valid key is done for the company, as if by the member who made it. A key or web hook that may have leaked should be deleted at once on the company's API page.",

            "Top-ups are sold by Paddle, who acts as the reseller (merchant of record): Paddle takes the payment, charges any VAT or sales tax, and issues the receipt or invoice.",
            "Credits belong to a company and are used for its candidates; its owner and admins can top them up. Credits can't be transferred between accounts or companies, sold, or paid out as money.",
            "Automatic top-up is optional and off unless you turn it on. When you turn it on, you authorise Paddle to save your card and to charge it the top-up amount you chose each time the available balance falls under the level you chose, without asking again. Paddle emails a receipt for every charge. You can change or turn it off at any time on the top-up page, which also cancels the saved card's authorisation; charges already made follow the refund rules below.",
            "Credits don't expire. Deleting a company deletes its credits.",
            "Referrals: when a company created through your company's link first tops up, of any amount, both companies get the referral credits shown on the pricing page, for up to 25 referrals a year. Referring your own companies doesn't count, and we may withhold referral credits obtained by abuse.",
            "Some credits are free: the welcome credits, top-up bonuses, referral credits and similar gifts. They are given once, as described on the pricing page, and are never refunded or paid out. Free credits are used before paid ones.",
            "Credits are only charged for what works: a candidate who never starts or answers nothing costs nothing, and the credits set aside for them come back. Generating interviews is free.",
            "Refunds: you can ask for a refund of credits you bought in the last 14 days and haven't spent, through Paddle or by writing to us. Once you start using credits you bought, you agree that the service begins at once, and spent credits can't be refunded.",
            "If a payment is refunded or reversed by your bank, the credits it bought are removed. If they were already spent, your balance can go below zero, and credits can't be used until a top-up brings it back up.",
            "We may change prices in credits or the top-up amounts. Changes apply from when they are shown on the pricing page and never take away credits you already have.",

As far as the law allows, we are not liable for indirect losses, and our total liability is limited to what you paid for credits in the last 12 months, or 100 US dollars if you paid nothing. Nothing here limits rights you have as a consumer under the law of your country.",
