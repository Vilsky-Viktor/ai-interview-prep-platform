# How to hire engineers: a structured process from job description to offer

Hiring engineers is expensive in a way that's easy to miss: most of the cost is your own engineers' time. Every hour they spend on an interview with someone who doesn't know the stack is an hour they don't spend building. A good process puts the cheap, broad checks first and saves the expensive, deep ones for the few people who are likely to succeed.

This guide walks through that process step by step. It draws on hiring research where the research is clear, and says so where it isn't.

## The process at a glance

| Stage | What it checks | Who spends time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Role profile and job description | What the job actually needs | Hiring manager, a senior engineer |
| 2. CV or application screening | Hard requirements only | Recruiter or hiring manager |
| 3. Knowledge screen | What the candidate knows about your stack | The candidate; you read results |
| 4. Take-home or live coding | Whether they can write working code | One or two engineers |
| 5. System design (senior roles) | How they reason about larger systems | A senior engineer |
| 6. Structured behavioral interview | How they work with others | Hiring manager, a peer |
| 7. Reference checks | Confirming what you've heard | Hiring manager |
| 8. Decision and offer | A fair, documented decision | The hiring team |

## What the research says

Large reviews of hiring research compare methods by how well their results relate to later job performance. The most recent major one, by Sackett, Zhang, Berry and Lievens (2022), revised earlier estimates downward and found that the strongest predictors on average were all job-specific measures ([doi:10.1037/apl0000994](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000994)). Their estimates, on a scale where 0 means no relationship and 1 a perfect one:

| Method | Estimated validity |
| --- | --- |
| Structured interviews | .42 |
| Job knowledge tests | .40 |
| Work sample tests | .33 |
| Unstructured interviews | .19 |
| Years of job experience | .07 |

Three lessons for engineering hiring follow:

- **Structure matters more than format.** The same interview with set questions and a scoring guide predicted far better than an unstructured conversation.
- **Years of experience say little on their own.** "Five years of Java" is a weak signal compared with what someone actually knows and can do.
- **Combine methods.** No single method predicts well enough to stand alone.

These are averages across many jobs and studies, not guarantees for your role. The authors also note that knowledge tests and work samples suit roles where candidates are expected to already have training or experience. That fits most engineering hiring, but not an apprenticeship.

## Step 1: Write a clear role profile and job description

Before you post anything, write down what the person will do in their first six months and what they must know on day one. Be specific:

- **Must know:** "Writes and reviews PostgreSQL queries, including joins and indexes" is testable. "Strong database skills" isn't.
- **Will learn on the job:** your internal tools, your domain, the parts of the stack you'll teach.
- **Level:** what separates a mid-level hire from a senior one in your team, such as owning a service end to end or leading design decisions.

Agree on this with everyone involved in the hire. Then write the job description from it. A job description that matches the real work attracts the right people and makes every later step easier to set up, because each test and interview can be traced back to it.

Keep "nice to have" short. Long lists of requirements put off qualified people who don't tick every box.

## Step 2: Screen CVs for hard requirements only

Use the CV or application for yes-or-no checks: right to work, location or time zone if the role needs it, a required language, and any must-have the job truly can't do without.

Don't rank people on their CV. Job titles, employer names and years of experience are weak predictors, and CVs are hard to compare fairly: a strong CV can reflect good writing as much as good work. Treat the CV as a filter for what can't be tested, and move everyone who passes to the knowledge screen.

## Step 3: Run a short knowledge screen

This is the step that saves your engineers the most time. Before anyone spends an hour in a live interview, check what each candidate knows about your stack.

A good knowledge screen is:

- **Job-specific:** it tests the languages, frameworks, databases and practices in your role profile, not generic trivia.
- **Short:** a few topics with about 10 questions each, so strong candidates with other offers still finish it.
- **The same for everyone:** the same topics, the same number of questions and the same time limits.

This is where prepza fits. It turns your job description into a timed multiple-choice knowledge interview. You review the proposed topics before any question is written, so the test covers your stack and nothing else. For an engineering role, that can include:

- **Code-reading questions:** a short piece of code with questions about what it prints or returns, what it does, why it fails or which change fixes it.
- **SQL:** a small table and a query, with the question of which rows come back.
- **Architecture and framework knowledge:** trade-offs, how a framework behaves, what goes wrong under load.

Each candidate gets their own random set of questions with a countdown on every one. You see a scorecard with every answer and how long it took, plus flags for too-fast answers, leaving the page and copy attempts. A flag is a reason to look closer, not proof of anything.

What prepza doesn't do: candidates don't write, run or debug code in prepza. Reading code and writing it are different skills, so the next step still matters. See [skills tests by role](/tests) for ready-made tests to start from.

## Step 4: Take-home or live coding

Now check whether candidates can write working code. This is the stage for writing, running and debugging code, either with your own exercise or on a developer platform. See [HackerRank alternatives](/compare/hackerrank-alternatives) for how a knowledge screen and a coding platform fit together.

Two common formats:

- **Take-home task:** realistic and low-pressure, but it takes candidates' evening time. Keep it to a few hours at most, say how long it should take, and review it with a written rubric.
- **Live coding:** shorter and harder to outsource, but more stressful. Pair on a realistic problem, let candidates use the language they know best, and judge their reasoning, not just whether they finish.

Either way, score against criteria agreed in advance: correctness, readability, tests, how they handle edge cases. Because the knowledge screen already filtered the group, you run this step with a handful of people instead of everyone.

## Step 5: System design for senior roles

For senior engineers, add a design discussion: "How would you build a service that does X?" Look for how they clarify requirements, choose between trade-offs, and spot failure points. There's rarely one right answer, so a rubric is essential. Write down what a weak, solid and strong answer looks like before the first interview.

Skip this for junior roles, where it mostly tests confidence rather than skill.

## Step 6: Structured behavioral interviews with rubrics

Structured interviews were the strongest single predictor in Sackett et al. (2022). Structure means:

- **The same questions for every candidate,** tied to the role profile: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a design decision. What did you do?"
- **A scoring rubric for each question,** with examples of weak, solid and strong answers.
- **Independent scores:** each interviewer scores before discussing with others, so the loudest opinion doesn't set the result.

Use this stage for what tests can't show: collaboration, ownership, handling feedback, communicating with non-engineers.

## Step 7: Reference checks

References can confirm what you've learned and surface concerns, but treat them as a final check, not a deciding test. Sackett et al. didn't produce a validity estimate for reference checks because the available research was too thin, so there's little evidence on how well they predict performance. If you run them, ask every referee the same few questions about specific behavior.

## Step 8: Candidate experience and time to offer

Strong engineers often have several processes running at once. A slow or confusing process loses them.

- **Tell candidates the whole process up front:** the stages, how long each takes and when they'll hear back.
- **Keep it short.** Schedule the later stages close together, and decide soon after the last interview.
- **Respect their time.** A short knowledge screen early means fewer people sit through long interviews they were unlikely to pass.
- **Give a timely answer to everyone,** including people you don't move forward.

## Fairness throughout

A structured process is also a fairer one, but only if you run it consistently:

- **Consistent questions** at every stage, for every candidate for the same role.
- **Rubrics written in advance,** so people are judged on the same criteria.
- **Accommodations:** offer extra time or another format to candidates who ask, for example because of a disability. In prepza, you can give a candidate extra time before they start.
- **Monitor outcomes.** Different methods show different score gaps between groups. Sackett et al. found larger average differences for job knowledge tests and work samples than for structured interviews, which is one more reason to combine methods. Watch pass rates at each stage.
- **People decide.** A score supports a decision; it doesn't make it. Look at the answers before you reject anyone.

## Summary

Put the broad, cheap checks first and the deep, expensive ones last. Screen CVs for hard requirements, run a short knowledge screen, then spend engineers' time on coding, design and structured interviews with the few who are left. Score against rubrics written in advance, and keep the process fast and clear.
