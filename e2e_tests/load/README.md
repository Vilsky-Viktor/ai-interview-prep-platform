# Load tests

[k6](https://k6.io) scripts, run in k6's Docker image (`grafana/k6:2.3.0`; nothing to install) against the running local stack. k6 joins the stack's Docker network and calls the gateway by name (`http://gateway`), so it loads the same nginx, services, Postgres, Redis and Pub/Sub emulator the app uses.

**Never run this against production.** The signed-in scenarios make users in the Firebase Auth emulator, so they run only locally; `load.sh` refuses them for any other host. Only `public` may be pointed at a test environment, with `BASE_URL=... e2e_tests/load.sh public --i-mean-it`.

## Running

```bash
e2e_tests/load.sh candidates          # many candidates taking a test at once
e2e_tests/load.sh dashboard           # company owners on their dashboard
e2e_tests/load.sh public              # signed-out pages and the public API
e2e_tests/load.sh clean               # delete what an interrupted run left behind

VUS=20 ITERATIONS=2 THINK_SECONDS=3 e2e_tests/load.sh candidates
PAGES=0 VUS=20 e2e_tests/load.sh public    # the public API only, without the frontend
```

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VUS` | 5 | Users at once |
| `DURATION` | 1m | How long `dashboard` and `public` run |
| `ITERATIONS` | 1 | `candidates`: tests each user takes, one after the other (each as a new candidate) |
| `THINK_SECONDS` | 1 | Pause between two actions: reading a question, looking at a page |
| `COMPANIES` | 3 | `dashboard`: throwaway companies, each with 3 finished candidates |
| `TEMPLATE_ID` | smallest usable | The local template tests are made from (never generated: no OpenAI) |
| `PAGES` | 1 | `public`: 0 leaves the frontend's pages out |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://gateway` | Only `public` may use another host, with `--i-mean-it` |

The defaults are modest: the local Docker VM has little free memory, and the frontend's dev server (3 GB and more) is the first thing to run out. Raise `VUS` a step at a time and watch `docker stats`. Run it with nothing else using the stack: with browser tests on the same VM, latency doubles and even the default run crosses the thresholds (seen: 5 candidates, `start` p95 1.2 s, `answer` 1.3 s).

## Scenarios

- **candidates.** Setup makes throwaway owners, each with a company, a test copied from a local template and the test's shareable link on. A company's welcome credits pay for 3 candidates, so there's one owner and company per 3 candidates. Each iteration is a new candidate: signs up in the emulator (verified email), opens the link (`link`), starts (`start`) and answers as the interview page does, `step` then `answer`, until the step says the interview is done. Answers are random. The link starts a candidate exactly as an email invite does (same sessions, same credits held), without emailing anyone or reading invite codes from the database.
- **dashboard.** Setup makes `COMPANIES` companies, each with a test 3 candidates have finished. Each iteration an owner opens their companies (`companies`), the tests list (`interviews`), a test (`interview`), its candidates best grade first (`candidates`), filtered by a status or result (`filtered`, every filter in turn), a candidate's scorecard (`scorecard`) and the candidates report (`report`).
- **public.** A signed-out visitor opens the home, pricing, FAQ, documents and practice pages, and the public API those read: the price catalog (`catalog`), the practice tests (`templates`) and the FAQ (`help_faq`). The first request of each page, which makes the dev server compile it, is made in setup and not measured.

Sign-ups, setup and clean-up calls carry no endpoint name and count towards no threshold.

## Thresholds

A run fails (k6 exits non-zero) when any is crossed:

| What | Local threshold |
|---|---|
| p95 of each API endpoint above | under 500 ms |
| p95 of each page | under 2 s |
| Failed requests (4xx/5xx, timeouts) | under 1% |
| `candidates`: interviews finished | over 99% |

These are for the local stack: one uvicorn process per service in reload mode, Next's dev server, the Pub/Sub emulator, all in one Docker VM on a laptop, often shared with other test runs. They catch a regression, not a capacity.

Targets for staging and production (Cloud Run, a production frontend build): p95 under 300 ms and p99 under 1 s for `step` and `answer`, under 500 ms for the dashboard's endpoints and `start`, under 1 s for server-rendered pages; errors under 0.1%. Check them there at 50, 200 and 500 users at once, against the `public` scenario only or on a staging copy with its own Auth project, never on production.

## Clean-up

After every `candidates` and `dashboard` run, and on `clean`, `load.sh`:

1. lists the throwaway companies and users still in the databases (`leftovers.sh ids`);
2. deletes every throwaway account (`clean.js`) the way a user does in settings (`DELETE /api/library/me`), candidates first, which also deletes the companies they alone own;
3. counts the rows left that hold one of those ids in companies, members, tests, candidates, audit events, rounds' sections, library's sets, billing's wallets and holds and users' and companies' notifications (`leftovers.sh count`), and fails when any is.

Only load runs' rows ever match: companies named `Load <run> <n>`, owners at `load-<run>-owner-<n>@example.com`, candidates at `delivered+load-<run>-candidate-<n>@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain, which delivers to nobody). The users' own local records are never touched.

## Results

First local runs of 2026-10-06, before the optimisations below, on an Apple Silicon laptop, Docker VM with 8 CPUs and 7.7 GB, about 2 GB free, other test runs (Playwright, integration tests) on the same VM at the same time. The numbers vary by 2x between runs; read them as orders of magnitude.

| Scenario | Load | Requests | p95 per endpoint | Errors | Thresholds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| candidates | 1 user, no pause (baseline) | one candidate's | link 11 ms, start 99 ms, step 40 ms, answer 47 ms | 0% | pass |
| candidates | 10 users × 3 candidates, no pause | 690 in about 12 s (about 55 a second) | link 183 ms, start 698 ms, step 365 ms, answer 335 ms | 0% | fail: start |
| candidates | 20 users × 2 candidates, 3 s pause (40 candidates, 14 companies) | 920 in about 70 s (about 13 a second) | link 416–713 ms, start 1.2–1.6 s, step 534–808 ms, answer 843–898 ms | 0% | fail: start, step, answer |
| dashboard | 1 user, 30 s, 0.5 s pause (baseline) | — | scorecard 198 ms, every other under 60 ms | 0% | pass |
| dashboard | 10 users, 1 min, 1 s pause | 977 | companies 179 ms, interviews 190 ms, interview 767 ms, candidates 155 ms, filtered 130 ms, scorecard 606 ms, report 637 ms | 0% | fail: interview, scorecard, report |
| public, API only | 20 users, 1 min, 1 s pause | 3,312 (about 55 a second) | catalog 42 ms, help_faq 16 ms, templates 372 ms | 0% | pass |
| public, with pages | 3 users, 1 min, 1 s pause | 192 | home 3.5 s, pricing 9.2 s, faq 496 ms, documents 462 ms, practice 436 ms; API under 100 ms | 0% | fail: home, pricing |

What the runs showed:

- **Nothing failed**: no errors and every candidate finished, at every load tried; only latency grew. The frontend's dev server didn't run out of memory at 3 users (it stayed at about 3.3 GB).
- **`rounds` and `library` are the busy services.** At 20 candidates `rounds` and `library` each ran at a full core (one process each) and the Pub/Sub emulator at two. Each `answer` publishes its event to Pub/Sub inside the request, and the event makes `library` update the question's statistics. Locally every service's subscription gets every event (in production each filters to its own types), which adds to it.
- **`start` is the slowest candidate call**: it reads the test's questions from `library` to pick the candidate's, then creates the sections in `rounds`, for every candidate.
- **`scorecard` is the heaviest dashboard call**: the full review of every answered question from `rounds`, an analytics event published inside the request, an audit row.
- **`report` reads every candidate of a test, unpaged**, and their scores from `rounds` in one call. With 3 candidates a company here (what the welcome credits pay for) it's fast alone; a test with hundreds of candidates was not tried.
- **Pages:** the dev server compiles and renders on request and recompiles when files change, so its seconds-long spikes say nothing about production; measure pages against a production build (`next start`) or staging.

### Optimisations

Measured on 2026-10-06 by switching each change off and on between runs of the same settings, several pairs in a row, on the same VM (at times shared with browser tests, which doubled every number, including endpoints nothing changed). Numbers are p95 (median), before → after.

| Change | Endpoint | 10 users × 3, no pause, shared VM | 10 users × 3, no pause, quiet VM | 20 users × 2, 3 s pause, quiet VM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `step` reads the candidate's sections once (4 database transactions instead of about 7) and no longer loads integrity signals, which only the scorecard shows | `step` | 714 / 584 ms → 477 / 271 ms (249 / 236 → 156 / 100 ms) | 321 / 176 ms → 227 / 128 ms (141 / 99 → 104 / 56 ms) | 220 / 321 ms → 394 / 235 ms (59 / 37 → 36 / 29 ms) |
| The same; `answer` also loads no signals | `answer` | 503 / 728 ms → 506 ms / 1.8 s (257 / 217 → 205 / 142 ms) | 242 / 152 ms → 194 / 152 ms (122 / 84 → 98 / 77 ms) | 179 / 363 ms → 413 / 254 ms (54 / 33 → 50 / 47 ms) |
| A test's page keeps the test's topics from `library` for 30 s (`SET_CACHE_SECONDS` in companies) | `interview` (10 owners, 1 min, 1 s pause) | 732 / 418 ms → 260 / 80 ms (93 / 300 → 17 / 14 ms) | 98 ms → 59 ms (59 → 9 ms) | — |
| The scorecard asks `rounds` for the review and the scores at once, and writes the audit row while the funnel event is published | `scorecard` (same) | 629 / 473 ms → 542 / 225 ms (211 / 280 → 124 / 65 ms) | 139 ms → 163 ms (93 → 50 ms) | — |
| `library` re-reviews a question's quality after an answer only once it has been shown `MIN_ANSWERS` (30) times: before that an answer can't change its flag | `library`, per `answer.recorded` event (150 events, real database) | — | 7.5 ms → 2.2 ms | — |

Medians fell for every change; the p95s moved with whatever else the VM was doing (a single slow request is the p95 of a 30-candidate run). Tried and not kept: keeping the test's questions in memory for `start`, which showed no gain locally (the load test's tests are small and each has 3 candidates).

Compared with [docs/capacity-and-costs.md](../../docs/capacity-and-costs.md) (an estimate of 100–300 requests a second per service): locally the candidate flow (mostly `rounds`) peaked at about 55 requests a second, with `step` and `answer` at a p95 around 350 ms before the optimisations above, while `rounds` and `library` each used a full core and Postgres under 70% of one, on a shared VM in reload mode. It's a floor, not the production figure, but it says the services' single processes, not the database, are the first limit, and that `rounds` and `library` are the ones to scale or optimise first.
